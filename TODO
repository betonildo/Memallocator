- Change Pool allocator to use an auxiliar array to take description of memory blocks
    - This will really use contiguous memory space

- Transform a PtrHandle to handle a single pointer and change
    2 levels of indirection to 1. The problem with one layer of 
    indirection is when you defragment the heap space, you lose
    pointers correct references. One way to avoid it is to set
    a kind of "listener" to pointer handlers
